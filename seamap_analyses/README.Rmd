# Data Provenance


## Offshore Analyses

Data used for offshore analyses of C. sapidus were taken from the [GSMFC website](seamap.gsmfc.com) in March of 2019 as csv files. Data cleanup from the raw GSMFC data to the final data put into the offshore model used in the manuscript is done in the following procession:

 - `seamap_analyses/offshore_analyses/R/gsmfc_data_wrangling/Seamap_Data_Wrangle.R` : Make necessary joins and drop unnecessary columns.
 - `seamap_analyses/offshore_analyses/R/gsmfc_data_wrangling/DistOffshore_DataExplo.R` : Perform any data filtering for bad observations and surveys outside this project's research scope. Estimate catch in hectares.
 
- `seamap_analyses/offshore_analyses/R/offshore_analyses/crabs_pre_hectare.R` : The restriction of survey years 2000-2018 and the designation of study regions are done here. At this point an "analysis data set" has been finalized and no more filtering is done.
