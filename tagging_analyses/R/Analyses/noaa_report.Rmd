# Basin Scale

##   Basin-Scale Travel Summary

o   Total numbers tagged when (maybe a figure with calendar month and numbers tagged

o   Maps of tagging and recaptures

```{r}
both %>% 
  group_by(tag_region) %>% 
  summarise(`Number Recaptured` = n(),
            `Average Time at Liberty (days)` = mean(time_at_large, na.rm = T),

```


##   Directions travelled (exclude crabs that travelled < 5km for this)

o   Raoâ€™s test for each

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hist(both$bearing)
hist(both$windrose_bearing)

#Circle Plots
region_circ <- both %>% 
  #Filter minimum distances out
  filter(lc_distance >= 5000) %>% 
  #Split by Region
  split(.$tag_region) %>% 
  #Pull the bearing info and make circular objects
  map(function(x) {
    bearings <- select(x, windrose_bearing)
    as.circular(bearings, 
                units = "degrees",
                zero = pi/2,
                rotation = "clock")
    
  })


#Make Plots so you can check orientation
region_circ %>% imap(function(.x, .y) {circular::plot.circular(.x, main = paste(.y))})


#Kernel Plots


region_circ %>% imap(function(.x, .y) {
  res_25 <- density.circular(.x, bw = 25)
  plot(res_25, points.plot = TRUE,
       shrink = 1.3,
       main = paste(.y), 
       #main = str_c(.y, "\nKernel Density Plot"), 
       ylab = "")
  
  })



#Rao's Test
#?circular::rao.test()

```


o   Crabs recaptured within home estuary

o   Crabs captured somewhere else

##  Travel rates (Maybe exclude crabs that have long times at liberty? Start with 1 month)

o   What patterns stand out: mean and variance etc. by season
